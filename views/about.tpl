            <p>The /v/GAs (<em>Vidya Gaem Awards</em>) were born in early December 2011 as a response to the Spike VGAs, which were widely regarded as terrible and a cancer upon the video game industry.</p>
            <p>A small group of anons decided to make their own presentation for /v/: after a month or so of planning, categories were made, votes were tallied and the presentation was shown to over 10,000 people live. It was widely regarded as terrible and a cancer upon /v/.</p>
            <p>Despite this, a slightly different and much larger group of anons thought they could do better next time. They were right in some ways, but mostly wrong.</p>
            <p>It looked like common sense was going to take hold this year; nobody was working on it and there <a href="http://vidyagaemawards.com/2013_old/">weren't any plans to do so</a>. Unfortunately, there was one anon who was rather persistant, and it looks like the /v/GAs will go ahead once more, albeit with an almost completely different team.</p>
            <h2>Why the fuck would you think this is a good idea again?</h2>
            <p>Despite the copious amounts of self-deprecation we use and the amount of shit that gets flung at us, we did actually get a number of /v/irgins who had positive feedback; many of them are now helping the show this year happen.</p>

                <p>The /v/GAs are run for /v/, by /v/. Despite popular belief, <a href="http://lereddit.com">le Reddit</a> is not involved at all and we go to great lengths to keep it that way.</p>
                <p>We're always happy for people to get involved: there are only a few people really "in charge", and that's only the minimum necessary to ensure things don't fall completely to shit. Getting involved is as easy as posting in the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/vidyagaemawards/discussions">forum</a>, joining the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/vidyagaemawards">Steam group</a> or hopping into <a href="steam://friends/joinchat/103582791432684008">Steam chat</a>. Just like anybody can make a thread on /v/, anybody can participate in the /v/GAs.</p>
                <p>You can see the 2011 and 2012 shows on our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/VidyaGaemAwards/videos">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
